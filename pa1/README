In this program, Lex.java takes in two input files from the command line, reads in
strings of words from the first file, and sorts the alphabetically and returns it
to the given output file. The list of words is put into an array of Strings in Lex.java, but
then sent to List.java to sort the array without tampering with the orginal array. List.java
has many functions to help with the sorting process, including a cursor node to hlep keep track of
where you want to insert the current array index.
