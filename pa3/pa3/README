In this program, we are going to take in input from the main class Sparse, whihc will give us the size of the input matricies in n x n format,
and then give us the non-zero entries to input into the matrix. The Matricies are made up by and array of Lists, with each array being a row of the
matrix. The function changeEntry handles all the matrix input, including deletions when we are changing entries to zero. We then test multiplying,
adding and subtracting these matrcies as well as Transposing.
