In this program, we are required to make a Graph ADT in C and take from the
input sets of pairs that represent edges in the graph. Once all the edges have been taken, we then
print out the resulting graph. After that, we are given sets of pairs to find the shortest path to using the search 
algorithim BFS. We then print out the shortest distance and the path between the two edges.
