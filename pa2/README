Just like pa1, this program takes in a list of strings from the input text file,
and sorts them alphabetically into a list, without changing the order of the input array.
Unline pa1, this program is entirely in C rather than java. This program requires the list.h
header file, which outline all the functions in list.c, which is just one ofthe differences between Java and C
demonstrated in this program.
