This program will take in an input graph similar to pa4,
but this time we will find the strongly connected components within
the graph. Using and DFS and transpose, we can figure out the strongly connected
components of the desired graph by checking which verticies have parents of NIL value
after DFS is ran on the Transpose of the given graph.
